Ok so once we hit 500 questions,
start prepping for facebook.

Be able to do the following:
- binary search
- deque
- heap with heapq (create, push, pop)
- dfs
- bfs
- in order
- pre order
- post order
- level order
- merge sort
- quick sort
- next lexigraphical element

./tricks.txt
./algos.txt

Figure out what this list is
Write code where you can implement it/have test cases run against it
Then drill tf out of the question list.

Write code that will randomly pick a question from:
- blind top 75
- top 100 liked questions
- top 100 facebook tagged questions

Remove all repeats.

Once we can implement this stuff easily and get all these questions right
the first time, then get premium and add on the premium facebook questions.


Have a list of tricks that we won't be able to lookup in the interview, practice them
