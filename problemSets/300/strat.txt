First up is facebook.

Be able to do all of the top 100
|--> Top 100 all time
|--> Top 100 last 6 months

last 6 months first, use a fake profile
then all time, keep track of what problem you left off at


Let's target 5 companies:
I'd like to be able to do the top 50-100 problems that every company
is most likely to ask

What companies do I want to target?
- Facebook (~300k)
- Google   (~300k)
- Uber     (~300k)
- Rubrik   (~300k)
- AirBnb   (~320k)

It seems like these tech companies usually just ask hards. I
haven't done many hards yet, however I am getting pretty good
at doing the mediums. So let's get to the point where we can kill
fb and then start on the other companies where there are lots of hards

Prep Level 1:
- 100 top asked fb questions (6months)
- 100 top asked fb questions (all time)
- Blind top 75

Prep Level 2:
- All questions at Rubrik
- 100 top asked uber questions (6months)
- 100 top asked uber questions (all time)

Sr:
400-600k
