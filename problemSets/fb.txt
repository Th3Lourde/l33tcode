Ok so we are going to interview in a couple of years. We are aiming
for facebook. What is going to make it or break it for us is our ability
to code.

Specifically how quickly and how correctly we can code.
In order to meet the mark we are going to do two things:

1) Be able to do top75 blind questions
2) All of the fb tagged lc questions

Let's start with top75 questions first. Before that we should
finish out previous attempt at doing all of the questions.

After we finish out previous attempt, redo the questions again.
Once we can get all of them correct and implemented within 10-15mins,
move on to the fb tagged questions
