So we are shooting for facebook.
Tbh I want to get 500 LC problems done,
hopefully doing the lists will get us there (they should)
once we hit 500 problems, we can do whatever we want

Be able to do blind top 75
Be able to do LC top 100
Be able to do Top Interview Questions
Be able to do all FB-Tagged LC questions

https://leetcode.com/problem-list/79h8rn6/

First:
We have done blind top 75
We have done most of top 100 LC
We have not done a lot of fb questions

Let's do all the fb questions we can get our hands on
Let's finish top 100 LC questions
Let's buy premium and do top 200 questions (sort by frequency)

Then:
Make a list of all of these, remove the repeats,
and be able to do all of them in 15-20mins.
