# Sort list of list by first element
t.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

# How to create a difference array in place:
diffs = [a-b for a,b in zip(gas, cost)]

# How to map [0, 2n) --> [0, n)
diffs = [a-b for a,b in zip(gas, cost)]
n = len(diffs)
cumsum, out = 0, 0
for i in range(2*n):
    cumsum += diffs[i%n] <-- this right here


# bisect
If we have a sorted array and an element that we wish to
add to the array. If we wish to insert on the left of any
existing entries we would use bisect_left

bisect_right, inserts on the right of any existing entries
