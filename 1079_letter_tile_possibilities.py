'''
Given string as input, return integer.

You are given a set of tiles.

Each tile has a letter printed on it,
tile i has the letter tiles[i] printed on it.

Return the number of possible non-empty
sequences of letters that you could make.

Ok. So we can vary the number of tiles in a
sequence

We can vary which tiles we add to the sequence
we can vary the order of the tiles that are
present in the squence.

So we have the part of the algorithm where
we decide what elements are in the sequence.

We also have the part of the algorithm where
we figure out how many sequences we can make
with the sequences that we have been given.

Fuck. Ok we have spent like an hour thinking about it.
Do a medium tree problem and go on to other learning.
