'''
An image is represented via a 2D array of ints

Given an image, coordinate in said image.

The coordinate has a color. That pixel is connected
to other pixels. Imagine all pixels in a 4-pathway
connection to the given coord, filter âˆ‹ the only pixels
we keep have the same value of the initial point.

Set all of those pixels to have the value newColor.
