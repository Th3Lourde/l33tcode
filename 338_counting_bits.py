Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]

Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]

the length of the output array is = |num|+1
I guess we count zero

bin(0):  0
bin(1):  1
bin(2):  10
bin(3):  11
bin(4):  100
bin(5):  101
bin(6):  110
bin(7):  111
bin(8):  1000
bin(9):  1001
bin(10): 1010
bin(11): 1011

I feel like we are supposed to be doing this with dynamic programming

















assuming number is greater 0
ans = [0] * (num+1)
exp = "0"
i = 1
count = 0
while i < num:
    #update
    # case 1: there is a zero in the expression

    if "0" in exp:
        j = len(exp)-1
        # find zero, in expression, set



    i += 1




So how to quickly calculate the number of 1's in the binary expression of a number:
import math

if n == 0:
    0
elif n == 1:
    1
elif int(math.log2(n)) == math.log2(n):
    # meaning that if casting the output as an int is numerically equal to that number

if n = 2^x x \in Z: 1


if there is not a zero in the expression:
exp = "11"
if 0 not in exp:
    exp = "1"+len(exp)*"0"
