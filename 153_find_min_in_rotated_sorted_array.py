'''
Array of length n is sorted in ascending order.
Array is rotated between 1 and n times.
Find the min.

Brute force solution: Single pass 0(n), find min.
There's probably a solution that is related to
binary search, so we might as well shoot for it.

So we are given that the array is sorted.

[1,2,3,4,5] â†’ [3,4,5,1,2]
               ^   ^   ^

We can write a modified binary search algorithm,
then search for float('-inf').

As we search, keep track of the elements that we
see, keep updating a tmp var so we only save the
min value.
